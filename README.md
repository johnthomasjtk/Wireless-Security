Tasks:

a) Simple Wi-Fi: Create a Wi-Fi network -


Simulate a Wi-Fi network with a single access point (AP) and a variable number of clients, ranging from 1 to 10.

Arrange the clients equally spaced on a circle around the AP. For each number of clients, simulate 20 seconds worth of network
traffic using the existing parameters. 

Repeat (or batch) the simulation for 20 trials, using a different seed for the random number generator each time, and compute the average total data delivered to the AP over the 20 simulation runs.

Plot this quantity as a function of the number of
clients, and describe your findings.
